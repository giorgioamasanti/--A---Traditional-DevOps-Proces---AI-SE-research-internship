Summer internship at Queens' College, University of Cambridge
Investigating the impact of AI in software enigneering and DevOps processes
Iam creating an application (Tetris in python) via 3 methods: 
  A) traditional, manual software engineering
  B) using an AI toolchain (which I have researched and planned) (GPT Pilot, ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot)
  c) using a multi-agent framework with ChatGPT (almost fully automated)

This repository is the code from approach A) traditional software engineering
